    <h2>Pedro Sánchez Blames the Blackout on Physics</h2>
    <p><em>13th May 2025</em></p>

    <p>
      Leave it to a politician to look at a catastrophic blackout and conclude that the real problem is the only part of the energy system designed not to fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the wake of last month’s national grid collapse, which left large swathes of Spain in darkness, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez took to the podium and, without a hint of irony, suggested that nuclear power had been not just useless during the crisis, but actively harmful. Nuclear stations, he claimed, had "been a problem", drawing “large amounts of energy” from the grid to keep their cores stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a curious line of attack, not least because it is completely untrue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nuclear reactors are built to withstand precisely the kind of event that occurred. When a grid collapse happens, and 15 gigawatts of generation disappearing from the system in seconds certainly qualifies, reactors automatically shut down as a safety measure. They then rely on diesel backup generators to continue cooling operations. This is a feature, not a flaw. The grid does not “divert” power to nuclear plants. Indeed, when there is no grid, there is nothing to divert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sánchez’s claim would be laughable were it not so revealing. It betrays not only a shallow grasp of physics but a deeper allergy to politically inconvenient facts. Nuclear power, long a whipping boy for the European left, is being sacrificed yet again on the altar of ideological purity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, nuclear’s supposed failure during the blackout is a red herring. The four reactors that were operating prior to the outage did what they were designed to do: shut down safely and wait. They did not hinder recovery. What brought the lights back on were hydroelectric plants, gas turbines, and high-voltage connections with France and Morocco. No one disputes that.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the more important point, and the one Sánchez is desperate to avoid, is that a stronger nuclear backbone might have prevented the blackout in the first place. Unlike solar and wind, which are prone to sudden dips and spikes, nuclear provides steady, predictable, dispatchable power. It also adds rotating mass to the grid, the kind of physical inertia that helps stabilise frequency and prevent cascading failures. This is why countries like France, which still take nuclear seriously, tend to avoid this sort of embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      So why pin the blame on reactors?
    </p>
    <p>
      Because it’s politically convenient. Renewables are the golden child of the Spanish government’s energy strategy. Criticising them, or even admitting their limitations, is heresy. Nuclear, by contrast, is an orphan—reliable, carbon-free, and entirely at odds with the prevailing narrative. Better, then, to rewrite reality than reconsider dogma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sánchez’s remarks, then, are not just technically illiterate; they are emblematic of a deeper malaise. We are governed by people who do not understand the systems they seek to control, and worse, do not seem to care.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is one thing for politicians to be unfamiliar with the finer points of thermodynamics. It is quite another for them to spout nonsense in a press conference and expect no one to notice. In an era of blackouts, energy insecurity, and geopolitical turbulence, basic competence in science and engineering is no longer optional. It is the minimum requirement for serious government.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spain deserves better. So does physics.
