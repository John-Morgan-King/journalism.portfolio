    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>With this portfolio I hope to showcase my writings and stories in my capacity as a journalist. I mainly focus on politics, counter-culture, and travel and the intersections between these subjects. For my third year thesis I covered how data farming impacts democratic processes but nowadays I tend to put my efforts into researching global energy politics. As for my interest in counter-culture, fringe ideas have a particular draw and personally Iâ€™m pleasantly surprised when I find myself out of step with conventional views. When traveling I'm always trying to imagine myself in other peoples positions, for better or worse, with differing degrees of success.
