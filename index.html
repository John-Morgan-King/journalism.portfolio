    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My primary interest is in energy, particularly the nuclear variety. While my third year thesis covered data farming and the impacts the practice has on democratic processes, my interests have shifted towards global energy politics and how this impacts international relations.

Subservice topics, typically in the veins of counterculture, have always piqued my curiosity. I enjoy learning and understanding fringe ideas and I’ve found it to be a pleasant surprise to find yourself out of step with mainstream conventional views. Travel has helped me greatly to understand differences in opinion and the (mostly) logical processes to which people arrive at them. I’m still formulating a worldview and subsequently always eager to learn. This website exists as a testament to this trait.
