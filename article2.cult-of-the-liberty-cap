    <h2 align="center">The Subterrestrial Cult of the Liberty Cap</h2>
    <p align="center"><strong>Date:</strong> 16 October 2024</p>
    <p>Between the months of August and December England’s green pastures are beset upon by small, psychoactive fungi. Psilocybe semilanceata, also known as the liberty cap, is a type of fungus that contains the psychoactive compounds psilocybin, psilocin, and baeocystin. The liberty cap, aptly named for its resemblance with the phrygian cap long associated with freedom in Europe, is not only one of the most potent psilocybin mushrooms but also one of the most abundant mushrooms in Northern Europe. The first documented case of liberty caps inducing a psychoactive reaction occurred in 1799 in London when a father, ignorant of their hallucinogenic properties, prepared a breakfast tea with the fungi for him and his four children. An hour after ingestion, the family were gripped by delirium, vertigo, fits of laughter and dilated pupils.

Mushroom foraging and usage, while not scientifically sanctioned, spreads through grassroots knowledge and folk traditions. Despite lacking historical evidence for ancient mushroom use in Britain, many modern enthusiasts believe in or propagate myths about secretive, ancient psychedelic practices. An overt manifestation of this folklore can be observed each year when neo-pagan sun-children gather at Stonehenge for the summer solstice and participants consume hallucinogens in mushrooms and truffles then cheer on the sun as it rises, bringing forth Britain’s longest day. A 2021 YouGov poll, indicating a shifting attitude toward psychedelics in the UK more generally, revealed that 40% of Britons believe that psilocybin mushrooms should be legal for medicinal use.
<br>
<br>

A loophole was closed in the UK in 2005 which allowed fresh psychedelic fungi to be sold in shops and online. Psilocin, the hallucinogen found in the mushrooms, was promoted to join heroin and cocaine as a class A drug. But magic mushroom loopholes have not totally been snuffed out; fly agaric, a fungi infamous for its psychoactive and hallucinogenic effects, is widely abundant, easily identifiable and perfectly legal to pick and consume in the United Kingdom.
<br>
<br>

Being one of the most abundant mushrooms in Northern Europe it is unsurprising the procurement of liberty caps is not complicated. As with anything the internet has made foraging for psychedelics more accessible, online forums are dedicated to their sourcing and identification. Typically such spaces are used for new foragers to post various mushrooms they’ve gathered to await judgement by, presumably, more experienced foragers. This practice first struck me as haphazard and besides the rules surrounding the presentation of the mushrooms, lacking a certain due process.
<br>
<br>

Online searches and forums dedicated to magic mushrooms have seen a significant increase in recent years, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, when mental health concerns were exacerbated. r/MagicMushroomsUK is a “harm reduction” subreddit “used for educational purposes” but is essentially an online space dedicated to the identification of liberty cap mushrooms. Attempting to source foraging locations is prohibited but generally users exchange tips, maps or warnings, creating a digital network of knowledge. I messaged a user of the subreddit and asked if I could accompany them on a foraging expedition and conduct an interview. The forager, who for the purposes of this article and anonymity would like to go by the pseudonym Mister T, kindly obliged. Mister T and I agree to meet in a car park in Essex on a crisp autumnal October morning and from there I follow Mister T to a field he believes will likely yield an abundance of mushrooms, psychoactive or otherwise.
<br>
<br>

I ask him how hard will it be to find magic mushrooms here? He responds ‘not at all if you know where they’re likely to grow… and they grow everywhere.’ Liberty caps are usually found in elevated sheep pastures, but from August to December, they're likely to grow in any area where sheep graze.
<br>
<br>

Unsurprisingly our conversations are filled with libertarian nuance. Unprovoked, Mr. T offers that “death cap mushrooms aren't illegal to pick and eat so why are libs (libs being a colloquialism for the liberty cap mushroom)”. Death cap mushrooms, common in England’s broadleaved woods between the months of August and November, are responsible for 90 percent of deaths attributed to the indigestion of fungus. Sensing the question to be rhetorical I don't mention that there isn't really an incentive to source death caps and they don’t fetch a hefty street value either, allowing the floored logic to slip by.
<br>
<br>

What if someone, whether innocently or even malignantly, misidentifies a mushroom posted to the forum? 
<br>
<br>

‘Well it's the OP’s [original poster] prerogative to take it [the mushroom] at the end of the day. Besides, most users exist behind a veil of anonymity so consequences only occur at one end.’ Fortunately for those in the foraging community, mother nature has been kind in the regard that mushrooms which are liable to be mistaken for the sought-after psychoactive fungi don’t induce any lethal effects, maybe other than a couple days squatting over a toilet. It’s unlikely that if the objective of a forager is to obtain liberty caps they would end up ingesting poisonous mushrooms instead, say for example the death cap, as they are not similar in appearance and grow in different environments.
<br>
<br>

What are you hoping to gain from taking these mushrooms?
<br>
<br>

“I’m not seeking spiritual enlightenment or anything but, personally, I’ve found the mushrooms to have positive lasting effects on my mental health. It’s generally just a fun way to pass an evening. It makes TV better and music better.” 
<br>
<br>

Have you ever experienced negative effects from taking the mushrooms?
<br>
<br>

“Not me personally but I’ve had friends that have abused them. They haven’t ended up in psych wards or anything but a common thing is distortions in their vision like eye-floaters, which aren’t pleasant and can last a few months.” 
<br>
<br>

After observing Mister T scour a small stretch of field for the best part of an hour he presents to me his bounty; a small plastic bag filled with liberty cap mushrooms. He tells me the next steps in the process are to dry out the mushrooms in a dehydrator whereby they shrivell to a tenth of their original weight. Mister T believes he has collected enough for several strong doses and estimated the street value of his foraged materials to be between £50 and £70. And just to keep my morality on an even keel I extracted an assurance from Mister T that he would validate the identity of the mushrooms with an online forum, but I suspect Mister T is probably the one doing the validating. The whole ordeal struck me as a fairly victimless crime.
<br>

The law came into force to protect “vulnerable people and those with mental health problems” from harm. However, a serious discussion must be had to explore if the contrary may be true. Emerging and consistent research has shown psychedelics help with mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, PTSD, and addiction. Benefits of psilocybin extend beyond medical advancements and the introduction of a legitimate market increase tax revenue, create jobs, and develop tourism such as the influx of tourists to South America to partake in ayahuasca rituals. A strong liberal conservative argument could be made based on the principle of personal freedom and cognitive liberty, allowing adults to make informed choices about their mental well-being and the legal exploration of altered states of consciousness.
<br>
<br>

A reassessment of a disproportionate law that pins magic mushrooms alongside crack cocaine and heroin is necessary and could be beneficial. Granted, it’s not an issue at the top of any politicians agenda, and most people won't even be aware that Class A drugs grow from England’s green and pleasant lands, but it could score some easy wins for a government struggling with their public perception. While it is true every year people die from misidentifying wild mushrooms, albeit the chances of misidentifying a liberty cap with something lethal is unlikely, and there are legitimate concerns about the potential risks of psilocybin. The legitimization of groups like the one Mister T belongs to and a regulated legal framework would make foragers increasingly comfortable in seeking second opinions of their finds and could foster a more open discussion on the topic. While it’s unlikely liberty would face extinction if legalised, ecological concerns, such as overharvesting, habitat disruption, or commercial-scale farming in sensitive areas, would have to be considered.
