Small modular reactors (SMRs) are advanced nuclear reactors pre-fabricated and transported by truck to a location for installation, allowing for economies of scale during manufacturing. Any SMR producing between 10-300 MW(e) could be classed as such whilst more conventional nuclear reactors typically produce between 1000- 1200 MW(e). In theory, SMRs would provide incredibly low-carbon energy to areas underserved by clean energy and help decarbonize the bedrock of industrial value chains. Difficult to decarbonize industries such as cement, iron and steel, and chemicals and petrochemicals, which respectively account for 27%, 25%, and 14% of industrial CO2 emissions, could particularly benefit from pre-fabricated, modular power sources. 

So what initiative is Britain taking in this potentially revolutionary technology? Surprisingly, quite a considerable one. Both Labour and the Conservatives prior to the July election were in favour of fast-tracking next-generation nuclear, a rare cross party consensus. The government is currently host to an SMR selection contest and has so far pledged £215m towards SMR development. In October 2023 six companies had been identified as able to provide viable, operational reactors by the mid-2030s. By June the following year EDF, the French energy provider responsible for operating the UK’s fleet of nuclear reactors, withdrew its Nuward design from Great British Nuclear's (GBN) SMR selection contest. Citing incompatibility with GBN’s  timeline. A reason as vague as it was concerning.

While the UK SMR-drive trundles along, Chinese companies are far ahead of their Western counterparts and have emerged as the world's leading proponents for nuclear energy. Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) recently published an article, "How Innovative Is China in Nuclear Power?" highlighting China's leadership in nuclear energy. China is seen as 10–15 years ahead of the U.S. in nuclear technology and driven by a coordinated government strategy with extensive financing and systemic support. Currently, 27 reactors are under construction, and China plans to build 6–8 plants annually, aiming for 150 new reactors by 2035, surpassing U.S. nuclear power generation by 2030. China's success is attributed more to organisational and systemic innovation, with policies supporting cost-competitive nuclear energy through financing, subsidies, streamlined regulation, and supply chain coordination.
 

SMRs are far from a proven technology and as of 2024, only China and Russia have achieved operational reactors. They’re slow to build, incur high cost overruns, and create new issues surrounding nuclear waste management. No SMRs are in commercial operation globally, and safety claims lack sufficient data. Whatsmore the government promoting this path to energy independence leaves much to be desired when we look at their track record of handling investments into large infrastructure projects. The UK's High Speed 2 (HS2) project, whose inception began in 2009 under a Labour government, faced multiple issues, leading to delays, cost overruns, and scaling back. Initially proposed to improve rail connectivity between London, Birmingham, Manchester, and Leeds, the project encountered escalating costs, delays, scope reduction and political and public opposition, just to name a few.

For better or worse, the growing sentiment that nuclear power is critical to the UK’s green ambitions and future energy mix has further deepened the so-called ‘special relationship’ between the UK and US. The four remaining contenders in the UK’s SMR SMR technology tender program offered by Great British Nuclear—Rolls-Royce SMR, Holtec, Westinghouse, and GE-Hitachi—are predominantly US-based companies, with Rolls-Royce being the sole UK representative. The future of the UK’s energy mix is already deeply tethered to the US and programmes like the aforementioned means this is increasingly so. And subsequently another reason to nervously watch this year's US presidential election. The nuclear energy positions in the Democratic and Republican platforms both support its continuation, but differ significantly. Democrats offer only tepid support, while Republicans strongly advocate for it.

Despite his isolationist and climate sceptical rhetoric, a second Trump administration holds SMRs in high esteem. Former President Trump has plans to support nuclear energy by modernising the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, keeping existing plants open, and investing in small modular reactors. He aims to reduce reliance on foreign fuel by using U.S.-mined materials and ensuring a fast track for advanced reactors to reach commercialization. Donald Trump whines that “Germany now is building a coal plant every two weeks and China is building a coal plant every week…and we’re playing games with the wind”. Trump’s positive attitude to advancing nuclear energy doesn’t stem from a desire to produce cleaner energy, but to reduce the United State’s energy dependence on other nations.

Pushing SMRs may be one aspect of Trump’s agenda Boris Johnson seems to be banking on. In May of 2022, Johnson failed to disclose a meeting with uranium lobbyist Scott Melbye while serving as prime minister. The lobbyist is the executive vice-president of Amir Adnani, CEO of Uranium Energy Corp, a US-based uranium mining company that was previously backed by former Trump advisor and current federal prison resider, Steve Bannon. Impressively Adnani holds down two jobs sitting on the board of Boris Johnson’s new green energy consultancy firm Better Earth Limited as Co-Director. Transparency diminished yet further after Johnson appointed former aide Charlotte Owen as the firm's vice-president, amid criticism for elevating her to the House of Lords. Not to mention the more recent appointments of Former Conservative MP’s Chris Skidmore and Nigel Adams as Better Earth’s COO and CEO, respectively.

Developing nuclear power has been a notoriously slow and expensive process for neoliberal democracies like the US and those in the EU. There is no doubt that whatever nation achieves energy supremacy will enjoy global hegemony. China’s headway in this domain certainly brings into question the UK’s strategy in answering the West’s energy woes. Whatsmore, if creating a cheaper, greener energy source wasn’t hard enough, the technology must also navigate through the murky waters of political corruption and the self-serving political elite.
