    <h2 align="center">Nuclear Risks in Conflict Zones</h2>
    <p align="center"><strong>Date:</strong> 18 September 2024</p>
    <p align="center">After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest, became a critical point of contention. Russian forces captured the plant in early March 2022, but Ukrainian staff continued to operate it under extreme pressure. Russian forces supported by armored vehicles and tanks, approached the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant invoking heavy fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces. The plant lost 1.3 GW of capacity, and damage included a bullet piercing Reactor No. 4's wall and an artillery shell hitting a transformer at Reactor No. 6. This prompted Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to accuse Russia of "nuclear terrorism." The situation has been highly volatile, with both Russia and Ukraine accusing each other of shelling the facility, raising fears of a nuclear disaster. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has called for the establishment of a safety and security zone around the plant, but the situation remains tense, with concerns over potential radiation leaks or accidents due to the conflict.

Nuclear power plants are attractive military targets and hold significant strategic importance. Controlling a nuclear plant provides leverage in negotiations and control over energy resources in occupied areas. Generating a large portion of a nation's electricity, capturing or disabling a nuclear power plant can severely disrupt energy supplies, impacting critical infrastructure, industry, and civilian life.
<br>
      <br>
The luring temptation for despotic leaders to covet such powerful energy sources is recognised by the Geneva Conventions. Article 56 of the 1977 Additional Protocol provides that:
<br>
      <br>
<em>“nuclear power plants shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military objectives, if such an attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population."</em>
<br>
      <br>
By mentioning only nuclear power plants, however, the article leaves out research reactors, nuclear material in transit, enrichment and reprocessing facilities, and spent fuel pools. Furthermore, its Paragraph 2 removes protection to nuclear facilities if they are providing electric power in regular, significant, and direct support of military operations.
India and Pakistan have an agreement known as the "Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities," signed in 1988. Under this agreement, both countries pledge not to attack or assist in attacks on each other’s nuclear installations, including those involved in nuclear energy production, research, or storage of nuclear materials. To ensure transparency, they exchange lists of their nuclear facilities annually on January 1. This agreement serves as a critical confidence-building measure, aimed at reducing the risk of miscalculations and preventing nuclear escalation, especially during times of heightened tension. Despite ongoing conflicts, both nations have respected the terms of this agreement, making it a rare but significant diplomatic success in nuclear security between the two neighbors.
<br>
      <br>
While the agreement between India and Pakistan demonstrates a rare example of nuclear restraint and cooperation, the nuclear dynamics between Israel and Iran present a far more complex and volatile situation. Unlike India and Pakistan, Israel and Iran do not have any formal agreements or confidence-building measures in place to mitigate nuclear risks. Israel, widely believed to possess nuclear weapons, particularly after one Israeli politician called for the use of nuclear weapons against Gaza, despite not officially acknowledging them, is not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and views Iran's nuclear ambitions as an existential threat. Iran, on the other hand, insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, though international concerns about its potential for weaponization remain. The absence of direct communication or agreements between these two regional powers raises the stakes significantly.
      <br>
Israel’s history of non-adherence to international laws is extensive. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) holds that Israel's settlement expansion in the West Bank violates Article 49(6) of the Fourth Geneva Convention, leading to expropriation, property destruction, and displacement of Palestinians. It argues that the settlements undermine the law of occupation and create lasting humanitarian consequences. The current conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants, widely attributed to Hamas's cross-border attack on October 7, 2023, has resulted in significant civilian casualties. Governed by international laws like the Geneva Conventions, both state and non-state actors, including Hamas, are subject to the rules of armed conflict. Hospitals, for example, cannot be military targets unless used for hostile activities, though this is contested in Gaza. Human rights organizations have cited potential war crimes by both sides, including Hamas's deliberate targeting of civilians and Israel's disproportionate strikes in Gaza. 
<br>
      <br>
Despite protection by international law, and the fact that an Israeli military intelligence chief has already told the BBC that he expects Israel to strike Iranian nuclear sites, Israel has a plenitude of reasons and motivations to target Iran’s nuclear facilities. First, it perceives a nuclear-armed Iran as an existential threat, especially given Iran's rhetoric and support for anti-Israel militant groups, which heightens fears of aggressive actions against Israel. Adopting a preemptive defense strategy, Israel seeks to neutralize threats before they materialize, viewing strikes on Iran's nuclear program as essential to preventing the acquisition of nuclear weapons that could shift the regional power balance. Additionally, Israel believes that a nuclear Iran could trigger an arms race in the Middle East, further destabilizing the region. Support from allies, particularly the United States, may also embolden Israel to take decisive action, as past military strikes reinforce the belief that such actions are necessary. Operation Opera was an Israeli airstrike on an unfinished Iraqi nuclear reactor in 1981 and Operation Outside the Box was another Israeli airstrike on a suspected Syrian nuclear reactor in 2007. Moreover, in September 2024 the IAEA and E3 (diplomatic coordination between France, Germany and the UK) estimated that Iran had acquired enough highly enriched uranium that would theoretically be enough for four nuclear explosive devices.
<br>
      <br>
The principle of safeguarding nuclear facilities from military attacks is merely hinted at in international law. The weakness of article 56 leaves room for interpretation and maneuverability, besides, the current geopolitical landscape reveals a troubling disregard for these protections. Israel has shown forth willingness to attack nuclear facilities and ignore international law. And while complaints are hurled at Iran citing the regime's irrational ideological nature in respect to the use of weapons of mass destruction, complaints could be in equal part aimed at Israel. As nations grapple with the perceived threats from adversaries, particularly regarding nuclear ambitions, the temptation to target such assets will lead to dire humanitarian outcomes and heighten the risk of nuclear disasters. Moving forward, it is essential for the international community to foster dialogue and establish robust mechanisms that ensure the security of nuclear installations, balancing national security interests with the urgent need to protect civilian lives and prevent environmental catastrophe.
